The dose will depend on your underlying condition and how you respond to the medicine.

You can increase the efficiency of the treatment by eating smaller meals more often and avoiding caffeinated drinks (like tea and coffee), and spicy or fatty foods.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most common side effects observed with this medicine include nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, flatulence, diarrhea, stomach pain, and thrombophlebitis (pain, redness, and swelling of the vein). These symptoms are generally mild but if they bother you or do not go away, consult your doctor. Long-term use of this medicine may lead to an increased risk of side effects. For instance, using this medicine for more than 1 year may increase your risk for bone fractures, especially with higher doses. Talk to your doctor about ways to prevent bone loss (osteoporosis), like taking calcium and vitamin D supplements.\\r\\n\\r\\nPAPCO Injection is not suitable for some people.
