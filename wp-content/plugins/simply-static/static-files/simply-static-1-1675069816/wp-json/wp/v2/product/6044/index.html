RABCO LS reduces the amount of acid your stomach makes and relieves the pain associated with heartburn and acid reflux. You should take it exactly as it is prescribed for it to be effective. \\nSome simple lifestyle changes can help reduce the symptoms of GERD. Think about what foods trigger heartburn and try to avoid them; eat smaller, more frequent meals; try to lose weight if you are overweight and try to find ways to relax. Do not eat within 3-4 hours of going to bed. \\nIn Treatment of Intestinal ulcers \\nIntestinal ulcers are painful sores that develop in the inner lining of the stomach or gut (intestine). RABCO LS reduces the amount of acid your stomach makes which prevents further damage to the ulcer as it heals naturally. You may be given other medicines along with this medicine depending on what caused the ulcer. You need to keep taking RABCO LS as prescribed by the doctor for it to be effective, even if the symptoms seem to disappear. \\nIn Treatment of Irritable bowel syndrome \\nIrritable bowel syndrome is a chronic (long-term) inflammatory disease of the large intestine (colon) that usually needs long term management. This can lead to bleeding, frequent diarrhea, bloating, flatulence, cramps and stomach pain. RABCO LS relaxes the muscles in your stomach and gut (intestine) and relieves these symptoms effectively. Usually, it is used along with other medicines for management of your condition. \\nContinue taking it for as long as the doctor may advise you to. You need to take this medicine regularly to get the most out of it. Take a fiber-rich diet, avoid oily or spicy food and drink plenty of fluids while taking it to make sure you stay hydrated. &quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:15295,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:16777215},&quot;5&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:[{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;5&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0}},{&quot;1&quot;:0,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;3&quot;:3},{&quot;1&quot;:1,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;4&quot;:1}]},&quot;6&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:[{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;5&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0}},{&quot;1&quot;:0,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;3&quot;:3},{&quot;1&quot;:1,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;4&quot;:1}]},&quot;7&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:[{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;5&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0}},{&quot;1&quot;:0,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;3&quot;:3},{&quot;1&quot;:1,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;4&quot;:1}]},&quot;8&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:[{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;5&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0}},{&quot;1&quot;:0,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;3&quot;:3},{&quot;1&quot;:1,&quot;2&quot;:0,&quot;4&quot;:1}]},&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;14&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:1710618},&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;16&quot;:11}\">In Treatment of Gastroesophageal reflux disease (Acid reflux) Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic (long-term) condition in which there is an excess production of acid in the stomach.
