					<description><![CDATA[<span data-sheets-value="{&#34;1&#34;:2,&#34;2&#34;:&#34;PAPCO Injection is a medicine that reduces the amount of acid produced in your stomach. It is used for treating acid-related diseases of the stomach and intestine such as acid reflux, indigestion, peptic ulcer disease, and some other stomach conditions associated with excessive acid production. \r\nPAPCO Injection is also used to prevent stress ulcers in seriously ill patients and is administered before anesthetic medication to help prevent aspiration-related complications. It belongs to a class of medicines known as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). This medicine is administered into a vein by a healthcare professional and will only be given to you if your doctor thinks that an injection is more suitable for you at the moment than a tablet. The dose will depend on your underlying condition and how you respond to the medicine. Your doctor will decide the duration of treatment but you should keep on taking it as prescribed, even if your symptoms disappear quickly. You can increase the efficiency of the treatment by eating smaller meals more often and avoiding caffeinated drinks (like tea and coffee), and spicy or fatty foods.\r\n\r\nThe most common side effects observed with this medicine include nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, flatulence, diarrhea, stomach pain, and thrombophlebitis (pain, redness, and swelling of the vein). These symptoms are generally mild but if they bother you or do not go away, consult your doctor. Long-term use of this medicine may lead to an increased risk of side effects. For instance, using this medicine for more than 1 year may increase your risk for bone fractures, especially with higher doses. Talk to your doctor about ways to prevent bone loss (osteoporosis), like taking calcium and vitamin D supplements.\r\n\r\nPAPCO Injection is not suitable for some people. Before taking this medicine, you need to tell your doctor if you have severe liver problems, are taking medicines for HIV, have ever had an allergic reaction to similar medicines in the past, or suffer from bone loss (osteoporosis). Pregnant or breastfeeding women should also consult their doctor before taking it. Avoid drinking alcohol as it makes your stomach produce excessive acid and can worsen your symptoms. Do not drive or use machinery or tools, if this medicine makes you feel dizzy or sleepy.&#34;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&#34;2&#34;:15295,&#34;3&#34;:{&#34;1&#34;:0},&#34;4&#34;:{&#34;1&#34;:2,&#34;2&#34;:16777215},&#34;5&#34;:{&#34;1&#34;:[{&#34;1&#34;:2,&#34;2&#34;:0,&#34;5&#34;:{&#34;1&#34;:2,&#34;2&#34;:0}},{&#34;1&#34;:0,&#34;2&#34;:0,&#34;3&#34;:3},{&#34;1&#34;:1,&#34;2&#34;:0,&#34;4&#34;:1}]},&#34;6&#34;:{&#34;1&#34;:[{&#34;1&#34;:2,&#34;2&#34;:0,&#34;5&#34;:{&#34;1&#34;:2,&#34;2&#34;:0}},{&#34;1&#34;:0,&#34;2&#34;:0,&#34;3&#34;:3},{&#34;1&#34;:1,&#34;2&#34;:0,&#34;4&#34;:1}]},&#34;7&#34;:{&#34;1&#34;:[{&#34;1&#34;:2,&#34;2&#34;:0,&#34;5&#34;:{&#34;1&#34;:2,&#34;2&#34;:0}},{&#34;1&#34;:0,&#34;2&#34;:0,&#34;3&#34;:3},{&#34;1&#34;:1,&#34;2&#34;:0,&#34;4&#34;:1}]},&#34;8&#34;:{&#34;1&#34;:[{&#34;1&#34;:2,&#34;2&#34;:0,&#34;5&#34;:{&#34;1&#34;:2,&#34;2&#34;:0}},{&#34;1&#34;:0,&#34;2&#34;:0,&#34;3&#34;:3},{&#34;1&#34;:1,&#34;2&#34;:0,&#34;4&#34;:1}]},&#34;10&#34;:1,&#34;11&#34;:4,&#34;12&#34;:0,&#34;14&#34;:{&#34;1&#34;:2,&#34;2&#34;:6710886},&#34;15&#34;:&#34;Arial&#34;,&#34;16&#34;:11}">PAPCO Injection is a medicine that reduces the amount of acid produced in your stomach.

					<description><![CDATA[<span data-sheets-value="{&#34;1&#34;:2,&#34;2&#34;:&#34;RABCO LS is a prescription medicine which is used in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (acid reflux), intestinal ulcers, and irritable bowel syndrome. It reduces excess acid production in the stomach and prevents the reflux of stomach acid into the food pipe. RABCO LS is taken with or without food in a dose and duration as advised by the doctor. The dose you are given will depend on your condition and how you respond to the medicine. You should keep taking this medicine for as long as your doctor recommends. If you stop treatment too early your symptoms may come back and your condition may worsen. Let your healthcare team know about all other medications you are taking as some may affect, or be affected by this medicine.\r\n\r\nThe most common side effects are nausea, stomach pain, diarrhea, flatulence, constipation, headache, weakness, and flu-like symptoms. Most of these are temporary and usually resolve with time. Contact your doctor straight away if you are at all concerned about any of these side effects. It may also cause dizziness and sleepiness, so do not drive or do anything that requires mental focus until you know how this medicine affects you. Avoid drinking alcohol while taking this medicine as it can worsen your sleepiness.\r\n\r\nLifestyle modifications like having fiber-rich diet, avoiding foods that trigger your symptoms, increasing fluid intake and regular exercise can help you to get better results. Before taking it, you should tell your doctor if you have any kidney or liver diseases.
